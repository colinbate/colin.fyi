`devd` is a more than your average command line HTTP server. Written in Go, it is designed to support local development work and is firmly based in the terminal. It supports reverse proxy, creating self-signed SSL certificates, complex routing and live reload among other things. As applications increasingly become compositions of small services, having the ability to easily setup and test these setups locally is a huge plus.
