If you've ever built a decent sized application using Redux (often with React or some variant) then you've probably had to deal with how to manage your async operations (API calls, etc). Redux-loop is an alternative, and from what I've read of it, more intuitive way to manage these operations. This is an alternative to Redux Sagas and redux-thunk if you have used those before.
