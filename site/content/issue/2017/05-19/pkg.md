If you have ever wanted to distribute your Node.js application as a binary without sources or run it on a machine without needing Node installed, then Pkg is what you are looking for. It will bundle the runtime and all of your dependencies (and assets too if you want) into a platform specific executable. You can even cross compile for multiple platforms.
