While text editors based on web technologies are popular right now (Atom, VS Code, etc), Hyper is a terminal application based on the same ideas. Available for Windows, Mac and Linux, this free software comes with a host of plugins available for customization and if you don't like those, just add some CSS and JS and hack it yourself. Supports tabs, split windows and a number of other features. The Windows version is a bit awkward to use at the moment because some of the keyboard shortcuts for the app itself interfere with key commands to send to the shell itself. But for normal use it is fine. And the macOS version doesn't suffer the same issues.
