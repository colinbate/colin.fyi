What if deploying your API to production could be done with four keystrokes? With `now` from Zeit that is possible. Now is a cloud hosting environment geared for microservices. Whether you have a static browser app, a Node.js API or a Docker-based project, you can deploy it very easily using their command line client or desktop application. They have a free plan which allows you to deploy your apps to `*.now.sh` domains and your source code is exposed as well (meant for open source projects). If you are looking for a way to host your apps easily without having to manage a VM yourself, this is an ideal solution.
